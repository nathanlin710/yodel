## Usage
Before building, make sure you create a `.env` file in the root. To the root, add your firebase API key as follows:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_BACKEND_URL=...
```

To build the project, run:
```bash
vite build
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the development server, run:
```bash
vite preview
```

or 

```bash
npm run dev
```
